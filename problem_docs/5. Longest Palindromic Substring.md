**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"
```

if this string have 2 or more palindromic substr.   I think it's ok, but we have to for loop all the string to find the longest one.

input 1, output 1

how to judge a string is a palindromic?

if len(str) = 1, result = str

bsdfg

if not, temp_longest = b

how can we judge a str is the longest palindromic substr?  

how can we check a palindromic str? 

1. if it real is  like aabaa.  [0,1,2,3,4]:   str[0] = str[4].  str[1] = str[3].
2. if this str is a even str abba [0,1,2,3],  str[0]=str[3] and s[1] = s[2].

the more general express is  s[x] = [len(s) -1 - x] . so once we get the identify of it. let's check it in code way.

added = tl_pldrm + x 

tl_pldrm = s

``` python
for i,x in enumerate (tl_pldrm):
    lf_index = i 
    rt_index = len(s) -1 - i
    if s[lf_index] = [rt_index]: 
        continue
    else:
        lf_index = (i + 1 if i + 1 <= len(i-1) else i)
        rt_index = len(s) -1 - lf_index
        tl_pldrm = s[lf_index : rt_index]
     
   
```

this method seems wrong.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

let's only look this example how to check if a str is a palindromic .  

I think it's a problem about index. 

when I check b, literally it's not enough.   at the same time, I do think we need to check the wole since we don't know if the whole str is a palindromic one .

so, how?

```
for i,x in enumerate (s):
```
